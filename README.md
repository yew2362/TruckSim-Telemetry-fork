## Known issues
### refuel-paid event not emitting
This seems to be a problem with the plugin.
It seems to only trigger once per game.

### Electron and React or Vue (webpack)
An common issue reported by people is getting the following error message when trying to use the module with React or Vue.<br />
`Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../../build/Release/scsTelemetry' ...`<br/>
This seems to be webpack related, and adding the following alias to your webpack.config.js file should resolve it
```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "../../build/Release/scsSDKTelemetry": "../../build/Release/scsSDKTelemetry.node"
    }
  }
}
```

For Electron you may or __may not__ additionally have to set the following preferences when creating your browser window
```javascript
webPreferences: {
  nodeIntegration: true,
  contextIsolation: false,
}
```

### Trailer damage values
The current version of the **[scs-sdk-plugin](https://github.com/RenCloud/scs-sdk-plugin)** does not provide the damage value for the trailer's body, as such the total damage value is also incorrect.
